 #Bugs to be fixed:
 1. predict function claims to have 3 positional argumens instead of 2
 2. Perceptron.fit

 #in third commit:
 1.fixed all #Bugs...

 #in fifth commit:
 1. finished coding the keras perceptron
 2. trained it one two types of datatypes
 
 #in sixtth commit
 !. added a new file Actvation function

 # added new items:
 2. FFNN and XOR code. yet to update the FFNN training and results
 3. good progress!!
 
# seventh commit
1. just finished training the ffNN and calculated its accuracy score of 100%
2. got everything working

 #tensoarboard training
 1. Trained my first FFNN plus the log files found in this repo

 #Convolution Neural network
 1. Added a convolutional Neural network and sorted the training data. few minor bugs to fix in the dimensoins of the input data though
 2. Added a second simpler model that classifies the digits from 0-9. works like a charm!! i will improve it with time. add more complexity and funcionality
 3. fixed some bugs regarding to the shape of the input data and kernel strides for the data. also add a dropout layer to prevent overfitting of the neural network
 4. fixed the bugs in the dogs vs catas image classifier. trained the nodel to an accuracy of 88%(neat). 
 5. network configuratio added to CNN. still buggy though, name scope error
 #KEEP IT UP!!
 6. learned what the rules are for a model scope name in keras.sequential
 7. created a tensorboard log file for evaluating the model

 #Emotion recognition:
 1. added a a fer nn. still overfitting. will fix the bugs
